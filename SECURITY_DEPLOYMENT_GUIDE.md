## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables
Set these required environment variables:

```bash
# Core Rails Configuration
SECRET_KEY_BASE=<generate-with-rails-credentials>
RAILS_MASTER_KEY=<generate-with-rails-credentials>
DATABASE_URL=<your-database-url>

# Redis Configuration (for rate limiting)
REDIS_URL=<your-redis-url>
REDISCLOUD_URL=<alternative-redis-url>

# File Storage Security
VERCEL_BLOB_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
VERCEL_BLOB_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
VERCEL_BLOB_KMS_KEY_ID=<your-kms-key-for-encryption>
VERCEL_BLOB_BUCKET=<your-bucket-name>
VERCEL_BLOB_ENDPOINT=<your-blob-endpoint>
VERCEL_BLOB_REGION=<your-region>

# Security Configuration
ENABLE_IP_BINDING=false  # Set to true for enhanced security
ENABLE_GALLERY_IP_BINDING=false  # Set to true for gallery sessions

# Development/Testing
DEMO_PHOTOGRAPHER_PASSWORD=<strong-password-for-demo>
DEMO_GALLERY_PASSWORD=<strong-password-for-demo-gallery>
```

### 2. Database Migration
Run the security-related migrations:

```bash
rails db:migrate
```

New migrations added:
- `007_add_security_fields_to_photographers.rb` - Account lockout fields
- `008_create_security_events.rb` - Security audit trail

### 3. Dependency Installation
Install updated dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

New security-focused gems:
- `redis` - Distributed rate limiting
- `mini_magick` - Secure image processing
- `marcel` - MIME type detection
- `connection_pool` - Redis connection management

### 4. Redis Setup
Set up Redis for distributed rate limiting:

**Option A: Redis Cloud (Recommended for production)**
```bash
# Sign up at redislabs.com and get connection URL
export REDIS_URL="redis://user:password@host:port"
```

**Option B: Self-hosted Redis**
```bash
# Install and configure Redis server
redis-server
```

### 5. File Storage Encryption
Configure encryption at rest for file storage:

1. **Create KMS Key** (AWS/Cloud provider)
2. **Set Environment Variables** with encryption keys
3. **Test Upload/Download** with encrypted files

### 6. Security Testing
Run the comprehensive security test suite:

```bash
# Run all security tests
bundle exec rspec spec/security/

# Run specific security test categories
bundle exec rspec spec/security/authentication_security_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/security/file_security_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/security/input_sanitization_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/security/gallery_authentication_spec.rb
bundle exec rspec spec/security/security_headers_spec.rb
```

### 7. Production Deployment
Deploy with security configurations:

```bash
# Deploy to Vercel with security settings
vercel --prod

# Or deploy to other platforms with environment variables set
```

## üîí Security Monitoring

### Log Monitoring
Monitor these security log files:
- `log/security_production.log` - Security events
- `log/production.log` - General application logs

### Key Security Events to Monitor
- `failed_login_attempt` - Brute force attacks
- `account_locked` - Account lockout events  
- `session_hijack_attempt` - Session security violations
- `file_upload_blocked` - Malicious file uploads
- `malicious_input_detected` - XSS/injection attempts
- `gallery_auth_failed` - Gallery brute force attempts

### Security Metrics Dashboard
Track these metrics:
- Failed login attempts per hour
- Account lockouts per day
- Blocked file uploads per day
- Rate limit violations per hour
- CSP violations per day

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Network Security
- **Use HTTPS Only**: All communication encrypted in transit
- **Configure Firewalls**: Restrict access to admin endpoints
- **VPN Access**: Consider VPN for admin access in high-security environments

### Regular Security Maintenance
- **Update Dependencies**: Monthly security updates
- **Review Logs**: Weekly security log analysis
- **Test Security**: Monthly penetration testing
- **Backup Encryption**: Ensure backups are encrypted

### Incident Response
1. **Detection**: Monitor security logs for anomalies
2. **Analysis**: Investigate security events promptly
3. **Containment**: Lock accounts and IP addresses if needed
4. **Recovery**: Reset sessions and passwords if compromised
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security measures based on incidents
